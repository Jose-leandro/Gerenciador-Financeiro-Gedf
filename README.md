## 🚩 The Problem

Managing personal finances shouldn't require mastering spreadsheets or switching between disconnected apps.

Yet many people — especially freelancers, students, and young professionals — struggle to:

- Understand where their money is really going
- Set and stick to financial goals
- Access intuitive tools that are fast, responsive, and enjoyable to use

Most tools on the market are overcomplicated, outdated, or ignore essential things like usability and accessibility. I built GEDF to change that.

3. Offers goals and alerts: set your savings target and get notifications.
